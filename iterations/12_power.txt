Power of a Number


Ram is in the process of learning powers of a number.  He is given a number and a digit.  He has to find the power of that number to that digit.

Example if the number is 10 and the digit is  5 the output should be 105 = 100000. If either of the input is negative, the output should be “Invalid Input”.

Help him do this by writing a program in java.  Create a class "Power.java" and write the main method in it. Don't use in-built method to find the power.
