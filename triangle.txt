Triangle Validation

Tom  is given an assignment by this teacher.  He provides him the length of 
the sides of a triangle and  asks if they form the sides of the triangle.

If yes, the output should be , “Sides form a Triangle”.  If not, the output 
should be “Sides does not form a Triangle”.  All the sides should be greater 
than zero.  If any side is less than or equal to zero the output should 
be “Invalid Input”. 

Note :  The rule for a triangle is sum of the length of any two sides [taken
in any manner] of a triangle should be greater than the length of the third side.
